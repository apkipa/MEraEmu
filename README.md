# MEraEmu

MEraEmu (Modern Era Emulator) is an EraBasic script emulator for modern Windows.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is not meant as a replacement for Emuera([EM+EE](https://evilmask.gitlab.io/emuera.em.doc/index.html)), nor will it ever be (no full instructions set support, for instance). The intention is to provide alternative experiences that are not found in Emuera.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is WIP (work-in-progress), and while some games are able to boot into gameplay, do expect absence of functions, glitches and crashes. Expect its performance to be ~4x worse than Emuera.
