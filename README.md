# MEraEmu

MEraEmu (Modern Era Emulator) is an EraBasic script emulator for modern Windows.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is WIP (work-in-progress), and while some games are able to boot into gameplay, do expect absence of functions, glitches and crashes. Expect its performance to be ~4x worse than Emuera.
