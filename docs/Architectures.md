# MEraEmu Architecture

## MEraEmuWin

MEraEmuWin is built upon XAML Islands v1, a modern UI framework supported by Windows 10 1903 and above. MEraEmuWin renders content with Direct2D + DirectWrite, currently to a infinite-sized virtual canvas provided by DWM, and so may be constrained by its limitations.
